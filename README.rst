Ignition
--------

Ignition is a Python tool that enables running multiple programs in a specific order and monitor their state. The run configuration is read from a JSON file.

The goal of the project is to provide a similar kind of functionality as roslaunch tool in ROS middleware while not being dependent and specialized for any specific framework. The run process supports external plugins that enable adaptation and custom use-cases.

Install from repository by cloning/downloading then run::

    $ python setup.py install
